# Team Contract (bangyan3, paiz3, yg17, yujiem4)

## Communication

1. **Team Meetings**

   Our team will meat once a week every Saturday from 2-4 PM in person. Each member will be the note-taker in turn  alphabetically. Notes will be stored and shared on a Google document, time-stamped for each meeting. The note-taker is responsible for recording each weak's progress on the project architecture, code implementation, and debugging.

2. **Assistance**

   Each team member can be reached via email and WeChat. Response time will be less than 12 hours.

3. **Respect**

   Each team member can freely state their opinions about the project, and the final decision will be accepted by simple majority. 

## Collaboration

1. **Work Distribution**

   Team members can volunteer to work on the necessary tasks each week. When no one volunteers, the team members will be alphabetically assigned with separate parts of the tasks. Adjustments can be made when necessary.

2. **Time Commitment**

   Each team member are expected to work from 2 to 6 hours per week on the project. If the tasks are relatively too demanding for one member, assistances are required from other members. If one member is unable to complete their tasks, other members may cover for them, but they have to spend correspondingly more time on the project afterwards. The bottom line is, no matter how much time is needed, each weak's tasks must be delivered under team effort.

3. **Conflict Resolution**

   All conflicts within the team will be decided by simple majority, breaking ties by flipping a coin.
